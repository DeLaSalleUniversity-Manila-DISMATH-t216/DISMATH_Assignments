# DISMATH Assignments Collection

1. Evaluate the validity of the following argument:
> " *Superman were able and willing to prevent evil,
he would do so. If Superman were unable to prevent
evil, he would be impotent; if he were unwilling
to prevent evil, he would be malevolent. Superman
does not prevent evil. If Superman exists, he is neither
impotent nor malevolent. Therefore, Superman
does not exist*."

  - For the portfolio, the only formatting requirement is **WEEKLY headings with itemized weekly learnings limited to ONE sentence per item**. (Of course, nobody will mind if you will show off with nice markdown tricks like linking/embedding images or perhaps creating tables, etc., but they're not required).
  
    Ex. https://github.com/DeLaSalleUniversity-Manila-DISMATH-t216/dismathportfolio-melvincabatuan/tree/master
