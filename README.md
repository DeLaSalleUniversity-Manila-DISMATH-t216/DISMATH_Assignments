DISMATH Assignments

1. Evaluate the validity of the following argument:
> " *Superman were able and willing to prevent evil,
he would do so. If Superman were unable to prevent
evil, he would be impotent; if he were unwilling
to prevent evil, he would be malevolent. Superman
does not prevent evil. If Superman exists, he is neither
impotent nor malevolent. Therefore, Superman
does not exist*."
